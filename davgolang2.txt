## Concurrency

<br />
Go is good at it!

# 

_Difference between concurrent and parallel?_

. . .

<br />
<p style="text-align:left;">*_Parallel_* - simultaneous execution</p>

. . .

<p style="text-align:left;">*_Concurrent_* - composition of independently executing tasks</p>

. . .

<br />
<p style="text-align:left;">Concurrency is about structure and Go provides good tools to express concurrent structures.</p>

# 

_Go tools for structuring independent concurrent tasks?_

<br />

- go routines - to initiate a concurrent task
- channels - to communicate between go routines
- select - to wait on multiple channels until one is ready
